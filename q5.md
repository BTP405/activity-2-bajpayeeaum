(1) In the first method, a list comprehension is employed to create doubled numbers. It initializes an empty list named 'res' and then iterates through numbers ranging from 0 to n-1. During each iteration, it appends the product of the current number and 2 to the list 'res'. Finally, the function returns the list 'res'.

(2) The second approach also utilizes a list comprehension to generate doubled numbers. It constructs a list directly by doubling each number 'n' in the range from 0 to n-1, inclusive.

(3) Approach three adopts a generator function to produce doubled numbers. It defines the generator function 'doubleG(n)', which yields the result of 'i * 2' for every 'i' within the range from 0 to n-1, inclusive. The 'yield' keyword is used to define a generator function.

The benefit of using a generator function like 'doubleG(n)' is its capacity to generate an unending sequence of numbers. This feature proves valuable when handling extensive datasets that may exceed memory capacity. Conversely, list comprehensions in approaches 1 and 2 necessitate generating all numbers at once, posing a challenge for processing large inputs.
